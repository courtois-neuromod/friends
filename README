# Courtois-NeuroMod: [friends subdataset](https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/friends)

The [Courtois project on Neural Modelling (Courtois NeuroMod)](https://www.cneuromod.ca/) aims at training artificial neural networks using extensive experimental data on individual human brain activity and behaviour.

Participants watched episodes of the Friends TV series cut in segments of ~10min while functional MRI data was acquired. A extensive description can be found [here](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/DATASETS.html#friends).

This subdataset is organized following the [brain imaging data structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (including extensions in development) and contains:
- [x] [raw neuroimaging data](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/MRI.html#functional-sequences)
- [x] behavioral variables in event files
- [ ] physiological data
  - [ ] ECG
  - [ ] pulse (photoplethysmography)
  - [ ] respiration
  - [ ] skin conductance (electro-dermal activity)
- [ ] eyetracking gaze and pupillometry (some seasons/sessions only)

*(unchecked are collected data which have not yet been integrated in the dataset)*

Courtois NeuroMod data are [freely shared with the scientific community](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/ACCESS.html) to advance research at the interface of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Access to to the data is based on a registered access model, see the Courtois NeuroMod website for more information. Redistribution of data outside of the Courtois NeuroMod data bank is prohibited.
